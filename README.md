# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-TREND-ANALYZER
# Project Overview 
The Student Performance Trend Analyzer is a Python-based interactive 
tool designed to compare the academic performance of two students across 
multiple tests. Users manually enter names, number of tests, and marks for 
each test. The program then generates: 
• A detailed test-by-test comparison 
• Average marks for each student 
• Identification of the top performer 
• A performance trend plot using matplotlib
